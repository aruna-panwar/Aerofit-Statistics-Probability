1.Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.

2.For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

1.Product Purchased:	KP281, KP481, or KP781

2.Age:	In years
